I have built a few websites for myself over the past few years, but was never able to see them to go live. I tried a few custom Rails/Angular solutions, but to get a simple blogging service up it was just overkill. I finally settled on Jekyll, which has been pretty 
nice to work with.

I am primarily a Ruby / Javascript developer. I plan to write about mostly programming related things, though I might throw in a rant or something here and there. My first programming related post i'm working on right now is related to writing custom sort methods in Ruby and the theory behind it. That will hopefully be coming soon.
